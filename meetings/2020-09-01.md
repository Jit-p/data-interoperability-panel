## Minutes

- Action - Justin and Sarven to connect out of band on shapetree repo permissioning / attribution


### Update on Application Interoperability Specification

- Justin: We added modelf for Access Grants, as well as operations how to apply permissions based on them. Now I'm cleaning up Access Needs. We should focus on project management use cases, we could use them for the primer. This would allow spec to stay more concise.

### Project Management Scenarios

- Pavlik presenting https://hackmd.io/qCx6-OGhRcKbF3miweJlLQ

- Focus starting with Projects / Tasks
- Incorporate Notes / Notebooks associated with a given projects
- Incorporate some events / meetings (possibly notebooks and notes could be associated with meeting minutes, etc)
- Also consider Audit Logs
- Each person and organization can use more than one storage instance
- Ensure any limitations around what works based on how storages are distributed are apparent and documented
- Consider a user being able to constrain their own access further than the constraints imposed by the server
- Cases where copies could be archived / backed up from individual agent storages in another storage
- User can use the application they prefere to smoothly participate across these projects
- Consider project dependencies (i.e. granting access to project X means you need access to project Y)

ACTION - Take this scenario and try to document it
