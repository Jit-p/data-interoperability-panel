## Minutes

### Use Cases from Benoit / Startin' Blox

- Cross organization chat channels
    - Each resource server is based on django-ldp (python based solid server - requires a bit of work to get authn and authz compliant)
    - Each organization has a pod
    - Each organization member is authorized to access the organization pod
    - Each circle / channel in the application can be cross organization
    - A given organization hosts a channel in the organization pod
    - Members of that organization and other organizations can participate in that channel
    - Over time would like it so that users have more mobility / portability - currently tightly coupled with organization.
    - Using XMPP for messaging
    - Currently working and have real users

- Personal data organization dashboard
    - Gives you overview of the data you have in your control
    - Ties in with chat channels / circles / messages
    - Ability to delete and/or download

BA: Idea to provide / create a use case template that can be used to model different use cases (i.e. which shape trees, etc.)

Action Item: Live workshop in upcoming panel session to model the multi-organization chat using interop patterns.

### [Consider scenario where application has access need higher than user's access #75](https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel/issues/75)

- Should be resolved by [#71](https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel/pull/71)

### [Avoid creating owl:propertyChainAxiom like properties #76](https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel/issues/75)

- Will update the spec to avoid duplicating the new property, but instead cache the triple in the access grant
