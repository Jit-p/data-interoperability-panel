## Minutes

### Shape Trees Update


### SAI.JS Update

https://github.com/janeirodigital/sai-js

PAVLIK: Focusing first on application use cases (non-trusted agents). Working through decisions on public interface, as well as promises, observables, lazy/eager loading, etc. Would like to hear from people about what kind of interfaces they would expect.

PAVLIK: In terms of data structures - application looks up receipts through application registration, data grants, to data registrations / instances. Internals don't really need to be exposed to apps - they are primarily concerned with data registration and data instances, plus who owns the data / their permissions to it.

### Jackson

- I implemented RDFJS Dataset, including subscribing 
- I'm working on ShEx to TS convereter
  - Takes ShEx object and exports TS typings (for IDE) and JSON-LD context
  - Another library takes in JSON-LD context and Dataset
  - Higher on the stack we get solid involved, give me URL and claim is of given type. It will involve network related aspects.
  - Also React library, use state -> use data
- Shape repo
  - whenever someone adds shape, it auto builds it and deploys to npm
  - developers should be able to reuse existing shapes
  - https://github.com/o-development/o-dataset-pack/
  - https://github.com/o-development/shexj-traverser
- LDFlex depended on Proxy which has problem of practically braking javascript rules, and makes it hard to use with TypeScript


### Actions

- Create issue to: add try links like in https://shex.io/shex-primer/index.html
- Create issue to: use shex.js to validate ttl and shex snippets 
- Create issue to: track down rendered HTML diff used by some by other CG https://g[A
