## Minutes

### Closing PRs from 2019

Pavlik: A lot of old issues / PRs from 2019 before the panel had specific focus.

Proposal:
- Merge old existing PRs into archive folder / closing with a comment that these are being archived and if they want to resurrect, to take action on it. +1 DZ, +1 JB, +1 EP

Proposal:
- PRs need to move forward within two weeks of requesting review

1. During the call, anyone who hasn't had chance to review PRs created after previous call either: 
    1. Takes action to review it before next call (or skips action and accepts)
    1. Everyone will still have chance to offer their feedback by creating issue(s) after PR gets merged.
