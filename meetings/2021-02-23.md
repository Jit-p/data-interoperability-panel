## Minutes

### Shape Trees Update

EricP: Migrated https://github.com/shapetrees/shapetrees.js to typescript, but looking to redo the tests using the new test framework proposed.

### Interop Spec

JB: Back to working on Discovery Section and Application Services

AA: Working on reference client library for interop spec

JB: Question on whether or not to include all interop operations and logic in one library, vs. breaking out into two that span trusted agent operations, vs. non-trusted.

RD: Should be one option that's really easy to understand, with a lot of automated configurations. Something for people that aren't very acquainted with it, but can get things done quickly and easily. Important to avoid people thinking interop is hard when in fact it is really easy.

HF: At BBC, they're trying to figure out how to build a media profile with a common shape tree where data from different places can be brought in. If they lived in a world where people describe their data with shape trees, they want to figure out how to merge data together, and store them so the next time around they don't need to deal with data diffing.

### Startin' Blox Use Cases
