## Minutes

## Public discovery use case

JB: Does it come down to tracking interactions in public settings vs. storing something natively in (for example) a remote data registry

EP: At a minute we should be capturing the use cases, maybe don't need to capture the solution

## https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel/issues/80

EP: In most cases software doesn't act on its own behalf - there would always be some social agent that is acting on the person's behalf. Software doesn't act on its own artificial will.

JC: How does this social agent come into play technically. We already have the notion of an Agent being who is piloting the application. If the software is strongly identified, the Agent and Application are the same. (For Pavlik) Do you see this coming into play in Authorization?

EP: Will provide more specific details in issue to clarify

## Startin'Blox use case workshop
