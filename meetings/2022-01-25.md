## Agenda

### sai-java update


### Storage without initial data registration

https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel/issues/228

* WT: Something I ran into - thinking about how to create a new pod and tell your authorization agent about it. How does the AA keep track of the storage location even if there's not necessarily a DR in it.

* PAVLIK: Two parts - have answereed one in the ticket. How to instruct the AA to create the container / registry in the pod, and then there's also the registryset in your webid. Probably authorization agent should take care of that as well. Nicer workflow - storage provider discovers your access inbox and notifies that with a link of the storage, then notifies the user to ask if they want to bootstrap it. How to keep track of the registration?  

* JB: 

* PAVLIK: Can be something we can hash out tomorrow in Authorization Panel about privileges of the Authorization Agent and whether the Authorization Server could recognize the Authorization Agent and allow it to provision.

* JB: I agree that AS would be good place to recognize AA designation in WebID Document.

### Strange definition of interop inboxes

https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel/issues/227

* PAVLIK: this is a bug so we should fix this (using ldp:inbox as a range). No need for hasInbox just define the hasAccessInbox. Action item - remove the hasInbox.


### Data registration vs. container

https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel/issues/225

* WT: I would like data reg to point to the ldp container.
* WT: It seems that Data Registration is the container containing data instances.
* JB: There is a requirement that data registration goes into container graph itself. There are few reasons why we don't point to the container. 

Action Item - Consider adding explicit reference to container in the data registration graph and don't make it explicit that it must be the container.

### Remote data registrations

https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel/issues/226

* JB: Do you feel like videos are still useful or they are misleading due to parts being outdated.
* WT: I think they are still useful. It sets good conceptual framework.
* PAVLIK: If you publish them on youtube then you can add some comment bubbles and annotate at the specific moment.


### App registration discovery: hashes or header?

https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel/issues/224

* WT: Requirement for AA to send HTTP response with header implies that it has to be server side .
* eP: explaining various reponsibilities of AA
* WT: Should spec specify what has to be implemented on server-side?
* JB: We tried to leave details up to implementation.

* JB: sai-java has interface for authorized session, there is another interface for authorized session accessor.
