## Minutes

### Mellon Use Cases

- Developing a decentralized network for scholarly communications
- Create a network for researchers to store docs / artifacts / etc in their own data pods and share them
- Interaction can happen over a dashboard of some sort
- Orchestrator (application) can be notified of new artifacts in the network
    - Receives notification events around artifact lifecycle
    - Can apply policies / move through states (registration, certification, awareness, archiving)
- Collector
- Additional applications
    - Using for museums for storing information about paintings, sculptures, etc.
    - Using for civil development projects (architects, builders, contractors)

- JB: Orchestrator and Collector are both applications?
    - RD: Yes - sees event change and applies policies. no hardcoded 

- JB: Purpose of the collector?
    - RD: Provide a way to browse through the artifacts on the network. Ability to query with certain filters, and see lifecycle data.

- BA: Current status of the project?
    - RD: Project began Jan/Feb of 2020. Mellon grant for their research group, currently evaluating whether using Solid is the best approach. 
        - 1 man team for now, another member joining soon. 
        - 2 or 3 people on the "public works" use cases but no detail on the deadline/status.

- EP: Can WebSub play a role?
    - Issues with spam in implementations of open inboxes.
    - Benefits to spam prevention
    - RD: Notifications are meant to be one time updates

- HR: Interested in other use cases for this kind of network?
    - RD: Yes open to input and collaboration
    - HR: Aware of issues with peer review network related to publications in clinical research that something like this could help significantly


### Startin' Blox Questions ###

[Reference Link](https://git.startinblox.com/applications/trust/interop-hubl)

- Each organization has a storage (pod)
- Each organization has one or more trusted agents that manage who is part of that organization, what circles are stored on it, and who else can join in that storage
- Each organization uses their own compatible application
