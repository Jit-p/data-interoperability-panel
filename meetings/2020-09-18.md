### Interop Spec - Update on Access Grants

Justin: I'll be pushing a lot of updates. For example task management can send access need request to work with projects. We have an operation to traverse shapetree and while grating access to projects user can only grant access to related tasks.
Pavlik: What does it meant that user 'has projects'.
Justin: Application can request access, as resource controller you can grant access to the application.
Pavlik: I talk about cases where user wants to restrict application (they 'pilot') in access to data they (user) have access to but not control. 
Justin: Current state of document doesn't address this use case.
