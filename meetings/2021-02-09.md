## Minutes

### Startin' Blox Use Case (Benoit / Matthieu)

Reviewing https://git.startinblox.com/applications/trust/interop-hubl

- Alice, Bob, and John are members of organizations (SB, HDP, HDL)
- Use two different applications for circles, directories, job board (only one app)

Remarks about the current status of the specification:

- Pros: Easy to apply once understanding the big picture
- Cons: Needed to go through the spec fully to get the whole idea

Suggestions of improvements:
- Consider some schemas / diagrams up front that explain the overall concept
- Remote data was a little hard to understand at first
- Not clear what referenced needs / grants are needed for

Action Item: Pull together some data schemas for modeling workshop next week

### Mellon Use Case (Ruben D)

Action Item: Pull together some data schemas for modeling workshop next week
