## Minutes

### [First sequence diagram](https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel/pull/97)

- Diagram is generated using mermaid as part of the CI flow
- Able to commit the text and generate the sequence diagram

JB: Propose that we use mermaid for diagrams in the spec

EP: Ready to review now - don't need to wait for additional PR updates

### [Define means for Access Grant Subject to verify Access Receipt delivered in Message](https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel/issues/107)

PAVLIK: Ability to spoof messages delievered to an inbox for access requests, access receipts, etc.

JB: Two approaches: 
- solid server stores the creator in auxiliary resource metadata based on the authenticated agent id
- a linked data signature / verifiable credential is included in the message identifying who it came from

PAVLIK: Prefer including signature instead of relying on server - gives more capabilities in various use cases - JB+1

JB: Linked Data Signature vs VC?
