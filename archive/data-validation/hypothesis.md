# Hypothesis for Implementing Data Validation

The material in this document outlines a hypothesis for implementing a shape-based data validation mechanism in Solid to satisfy the stated [use cases](use-cases.md). This hypothesis will be validated and refined through critical review and prototyping, with the end result being input into a candidate proposal to the [Solid Specification](https://github.com/solid/specification).
