# Data Validation in Solid

A project undertaken by the [Data Interoperability Panel](https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel). See the [original project proposal](https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel/issues/1).

## Goal

The aim of this project is to produce a candidate proposal to the Solid Specification that defines how and when to apply shape-based data validation as data is written/modified in the pod.

## Milestones

1. Write [use cases](use-cases.md)
2. Write [hypothesis](hypothesis.md) for intended approach
3. Create prototype *(with supporting documentation in refined hypothesis)*
4. Write and submit candidate proposal to specification
