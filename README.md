# Solid Data Interoperability Panel

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/solid/data-interoperability-panel](https://badges.gitter.im/solid/data-interoperability-panel.svg)](https://gitter.im/solid/data-interoperability-panel?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

## Purpose

We must be able to support data interoperability across applications while enabling secure collaboration and query using intuitive data boundaries.

Diversity in how the same data will be accessed and manipulated by different entities and applications exacerbates the need for reliable mechanisms that protect against data corruption, data leakage, or broken workflows

Standard methods and mechanisms for interoperability, collaboration, and security of data in a Solid Pod must realize these needs, and it must be done without changing the fundamentals of Solid.

Read our stated [Problems and Goals](problems-and-goals.md) for an in-depth understanding of the panel's focus.

## Completed Initiatives

[Resource Metadata](https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel/tree/master/archive/resource-metadata) - Resource Metadata was [submitted](solid/specification#156) as a candidate proposal to the solid/specification. It was renamed to Auxiliary Resources during Editorial Review.

## Meetings

Panel meetings are held most Tuesdays at 10:00AM Eastern / 4:00PM Central European. Check-in on [gitter](https://gitter.im/solid/data-interoperability-panel) for weekly agenda.

Meeting URL: https://meet.jit.si/solid-data-interoperability

Panel meeting minutes are recorded live and are [available here](https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel/blob/master/meetings/)

## Process

Initiative proposals must be [submitted as issues](https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel/issues/new), and receive support from members of the panel. At least three panelists (not including the panelist proposing the project) must support creation of the project, with no panel members actively rejecting it. Initiative proposals with support will be prioritized and undertaken by the panel.

Substantive changes submitted to active panel initiatives should be submitted as pull requests, and should receive at least two approved reviews from panelists, with no one actively rejecting.

Panel members should work together to settle deadlocks. It may be helpful to request the perspective of a Solid Editor that would ultimately be responsible for accepting submitted candidate proposals to settle deadlocks.
